- [x] Create a local NATS cluster with JetStream streams using JetStream terraform provider
  - [x] The streams should function as interest-based, durable queues
  - [x] Create ~two consumers that pull items from the queues for work
- [x] The local NATS cluster should use decentralized auth so it can be added as a remote system in Synadia Cloud
- [ ] Import the local system into Synadia Cloud
- [ ] Mirror/source the streams into cloud
- [ ] Use JetStream renaming techniques from this blog post to create a "single" stream?
